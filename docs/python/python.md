# Python

A data type serves as a categorization of data, defining the specific type of value that can be stored in a variable or expression. On the other hand, a data structure is a method of organizing and storing data in computer memory, ensuring efficient access and manipulation of the stored information

Assume a box and you put a label on that according to what you want to store in it, that label is called data type and how you arrange those boxes is data structures. For example stack, queue, linklist, trees are data structures, Where as int, float, double, bool are data types. Array is a data structures where each element (boxes) are placed at continuous location(one after another).

# Built-in Types
1.Numeric Types - int, float, complex

2.Boolean Type - bool

3.Sequence Types — list, tuple, range

4.Text Sequence Type — str

5.Binary Sequence Types — bytes, bytearray, memoryview

6.Set Types — set, frozenset

7.Mapping Types — dict

# Built-in Data Structures
list, tuples, set, dictionary

# array vs list
list is dynamic array. Array is basic ADT. And Python does not have built-in support for Arrays.
Arrays have a fixed size set during creation. Lists are dynamic and can change in size during runtime.
