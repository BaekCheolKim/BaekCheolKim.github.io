Event Space, denoted ℱ, is the set of all
events.
• ℱ collection of all subsets of Ω including:
– Ω itself, meaning the sure event that “the
outcome is in Ω”
– The empty set ∅, meaning the impossible
event that “the outcome is not in Ω”

Dice Roll Example
• Random Experiment = Roll of Two Dice
• Sample Space Ω = { 𝑖, 𝑗 : 1 ≤ 𝑖, 𝑗 ≤ 6}
• Example Event = The sum of the two dice is 12, i.e. { 6,6 }
• Event Space ℱ =
{∅,Ω, 1,1 , 1,2 , 1,3 ,…, 6,6 ,…}
