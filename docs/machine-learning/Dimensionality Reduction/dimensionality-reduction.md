# dimensionality
Imagine a dataset with information about houses, including price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and location (city). This data has dimensionality 4 (price, square footage, bedrooms, and city). If you store this data in a NumPy array, the array would likely have one row for each house and four columns representing the four features.
